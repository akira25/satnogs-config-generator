# Draft: Satnogs-Config-generator

This is a draft for a static website that generates an env-file for [satnogs-client](https://gitlab.com/librespacefoundation/satnogs/satnogs-client).

## Current State

At the time of writing (Jan 2026), I consider this still draft state. It generates valid files already, though. Feel free to use it, if it suits you.

## Future Research

This could be integrated into satnogs-client as a configuration tool via web-browser.
